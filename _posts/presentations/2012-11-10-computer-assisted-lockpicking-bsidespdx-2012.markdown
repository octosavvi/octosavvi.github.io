This talk was submitted under a really strange title.  The editor's note indicating "this talk is about lockpicking" was very useful.  A curious audience tolerated many technical difficulties before getting to see real-time force graphs of tools being used to pick a lock.  When a pinstack is set, the graph shows very distinctive force drops and spikes as collected by the strain gauges attached to the pick and torsion tool.

No slides were created for this presentation.  It was 100% demo and looking at hardware.
