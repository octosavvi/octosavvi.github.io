This 4-hour workshop did not come with slides.  An introduction discussion about what to look for and how to get started was followed by hands on lab.  We dug into bins of real actual assorted cheap hardware (from FreeGeek) and struggled through finding consoles on unfamiliar devices.  With people working on a variety of devices, we made several stops along the way to look at interesting characteristics of specific boards and how they might be interpreted to get us closer to finding secrets.
