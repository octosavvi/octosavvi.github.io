This 2-hour workshop covered specific tips and tricks for picking spool and serrated pins.  We were setting the bar for "advanced" based on a local level.  Obviously, this would have been pretty beginner stuff for the international LockSport community.  The workshop later turned to a photo-gallery tour of Portland municipal locks including commentary about interesting lock characteristics and approximations of security over asset value.
