### Abloy "high security" cam locks can easily be opened with a bolt and hammer.

Huge thanks go to [bosnianbill](https://youtube.com/user/bosnianbill/about) for recording this informative video and working with me to publicly disclose an interesting physical security vulnerability.  Go subscribe to Bill's [locktube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1orOGJwZvjLAvckyxC4Nw) channel.

This weakness is not shared with the ruggedized Abloy CL110 cam lock.  Abloy mortise cylinders only used this retaining mechanism from 1984-1987.

There was significant confusion about the applicability of the mortise cylinder attack Bill demonstrated.  The chances of this attack being effective against a mortise cylinder in the field are very low.  But don't be distracted, this attack is *very effective against Abloy cam locks*.
